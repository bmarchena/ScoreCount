# ScoreCount
Two team score counter using two activities and explicit intent.

In this application, the user uses two buttons to increment the scores of two teams starting from 0. Once a team
reaches a score of 5, the "game" ends and that team is determined to be the winner. A second activity is started which
declares the winner and also calculates and outputs the score spread of the game.
